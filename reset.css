/*A few things to note As you can see,
I’ve included a rule so that images are responsive by default. 
Arguably the most important part of this CSS reset is the box-sizing: border-box,
as this will ensure consistent and predictable sizing. 
The default value of content-box doesn’t account for the padding or border. 
You can remove the rule for ol and ul if you want to keep the default bullet points for your lists. 
With font-weight: normal headings won’t be bolded by default.
Remove that if you don’t mind the default look. I’ve set the default font size to be 16px. 
Everything else can be specified in rem units and it will be based off of that 16px. Then,
if you want to adjust globally to make the text a little larger overall,
you can change the base rule for something like 17 or 18px.
